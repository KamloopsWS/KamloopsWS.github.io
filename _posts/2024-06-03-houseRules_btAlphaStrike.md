### --- **Common Game Terms** ---

**Contested:**
If both players have units overlapping any part of an OAT in the End Phase, the OAT is considered to be contested.
Note that during King of the Hill mission type the OAT is only contested if both players units weight sum are the same.
 
**Errata:**
These are rules that have been updated or clarified between printings.
AS:CE - www.bg.battletech.com/errata/
 
**MUL:**
Abbreviation for Master Unit List. The Master Unit List is the official repository of all units that are available to the Battletech universe.
Website is here: www.masterunitlist.info
 
**Multiple Attack Rolls:**
Separate attack rolls (2D6) are made for each point of damage the unit would deliver at that range.
See Multiple Attack Rolls in the AS:CE book for more details on detailing Special Weapon Attacks.
 
**OAT:**
Objective Area Template... These templates mark the objectives within various scenarios.
 
**Objective Area:**
If both players have units overlapping any part of an OAT in the End Phase, the OAT is considered to be contested.
Note that during King of the Hill mission type the Objective area is only contested if both players units weight sum are the same.
 
**Proxy:**
A proxy is something you use to represent a model that you do not have.
This proxy should be of the same type (mech, combat vehicle or battle armor), similar size and shape.

### --- **Faction and ERA** ---

Each Player must choose one Faction and one Availability Era table to make their army.
 
Units selected outside the player's chosen Faction and Era are deemed to be invalid and are removed from that player's army for the remainder of the game and/or tournament.
 
On the FACTIONS tab in the MUL, pick a Faction then an Availability Era.
You will notice when your unit list is tabulated if additional faction lists should be included for your chosen faction, it is included in gray just to the right of the Faction and Era chosen.
When creating your list be sure to include this Generic List in your filter options on the UNITS tab.
 
**NOTE:** Battle Armor Unit Squad sizes are dependent on the Faction and Era chosen by the player.

### --- **Army Construction Rules** ---

Uses mostly standard WOLF Net 350 ([found here](https://wolfsdragoons.com/alpha-strike-core-tournament-rules-2/){:target="_blank"})... except where noted below.

Regarding "Units with the following special abilities can be taken but are unable to use that ability."

Restrictions are lifted on the use of special abilities on the following: ART-TC, ART-SC, ART-LTC, ART-LT, BOMB, DCC, MDS.

HPG is still unavailable for use as per WolfNet rules.

### --- **Active House Rules** ---

#### AMS
**Summary:**
AMS protects all friendly units within a 6 inch AOE template around the unit with AMS.
 

#### Battlefield Intelligence
**Summary:**
If one or both players have at least 1 unit with the relevant specials (MHQ / Recon) then this rule is active...
The player with the highest count of units with relevant specials (MHQ / Recon) gains a +1 initiative mod.
This comparison above occurs before every turns initiative roll because attrition may effect the battlefield intelligence situation.
 
**Note:**
As per vanilla rules the Probe special confers the Recon special.
 
#### Probe
**Summary:**
Units with Active Probe (PRB) special gain the ability to spot for indirect fire using the probe in addition to the vanilla option aka eyeball and radio.
 
**Effect:**
- Spotting using a Probe for IF attacks comes with an additional +1 attack mod penalty to the IF-ing unit, there is no additional penalty to the spotter.
- The previously mentioned IF-ing unit attack mod penalty stacks with the standard IF attack penalty on the IF'er of +1 if spotter did not fire or +2 for IF'er if spotter fired.
- Probes can be used to spot a target through LOS blocking terrain but the target still retains any relevant cover and/or terrain defense modifiers.
 
**Tactics:**
Often when probe spotting the spotter would be better off not shooting during the spotting turn so that the IFers only get a +2 (+1 IF, +1 Probe). If engaging in combat while spotting remember that the spotter gains a +1 attack mod and would be recommended to choose vanilla spotting (aka eyeball and radio) due to the IFer getting a +2 (+2 IF w/spotter fired)... if you choose to shoot and spot with probe the IFer would have a +3 attack mod (+2 IF w/spotter fired, +1 Probe).
