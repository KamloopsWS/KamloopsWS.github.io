**This mission format has been forked from the Brooklyn BattleTech Format.**

### --- **Scenario Setup** ---
Each player rolls 2d6, the winner chooses to be the attacker or defender. 
The attacker/defender roles may be preassigned as part of a league or campaign. 
The attacker selects the map, and then rolls to select the scenario. 
After the roll, either player may spend their Edge (in KWS terms this is your once a game mulligan) to veto up to three scenarios. 
The scenario is then rerolled until a non-vetoed scenario is selected. The defender selects their home edge.

**Scenario:** Each will roll two individual 1D6 for Scenario to determine the scenario selection (like a critical):

**Result: 1-3**
1. Standup Fight
2. Assassination
3. Breakthrough
4. Map Control
5. Recon Raid
6. Objective Raid

**Result: 4-6**
1. Standup Fight
2. Extraction Raid
3. Point Control (New)
4. Control Raid
5. Roadblock
6. Domination

**Secondary Objective:** Each will roll two individual 1D6 (like a critical) to determine their individual secondary objectives:

**Result: 1-3**
1. Capture
2. Scouting
3. Clear the Air
4. One Hand Tied
5. Anti-Missile
6. Wet-Work

**Result: 4-6**
1. New Guy Syndrome
2. Suppressing Fire
3. Size Up 
4. Limit Mobility
5. Demonstrate Dominance
6. Push them Around

**Map:** For Hexes: Two Mapsheets, touching at the long edge. BattleMats or the double-wide Mapsheets from the Reinforcement Boxset are the preferred map format as they lack the empty seam between the two sheets.

### --- **Scenarios** ---

#### **#1) Standup Fight**
In a stand-up fight, the simplest and most common scenario, two forces of roughly equal size square off against each other. Only one side leaves the field alive. The scenario ends when all the units on one side have been destroyed or been put into forced withdrawal. The surviving side at the end of the scenario completes the primary scenario objectives.

![Alt text](/uploads/bt_smap/bt_smap1.PNG)

The attacker and defender deploy on their home edge’s deployment zone using the standard initiative order. 


#### **#2) Assasination** 
In this Assasination scenario, each side is attempting to kill the enemy commander before retreating off their Home Edge. Each player will select either a mech with the highest BV or the highest tonnage Mech to be their team's commander, and mark that unit's record sheet accordingly. If there is no Mech as part of the players force, the highest BV unit will be designated the commander unit. The commander cannot be placed into forced withdrawal. The winner of the primary objective is determined via a modified combat score calculation.

![Alt text](/uploads/bt_smap/bt_smap2.PNG)

Both teams will deploy into their Home Edge’s deployment zones using the standard initiative order using standard rules. After the opposing Commander unit has been destroyed, the player may start to retreat their remaining units off their home Edge to end the Scenario. Any unit that leaves the playing area, not via their Home Edge, is considered destroyed.

Both players start with 0 Victory Points. For every enemy unit destroyed, add twice its point value to your total (including the points for the pilot, if any). The commander units are worth three times their total point value. For each of your units destroyed, deduct the point value of the unit (plus the pilot) from your score. The scenario ends when all the units on one side have been destroyed or been put into forced withdrawal. At the end of the scenario, the side with the most points wins. If the players’ scores are tied at the end of the scenario, the game is considered a draw. Note: Victory Points in this scenario are different from the Combat Score.


#### **#3) Breakthrough**
In the Breakthrough scenario, the attacking player’s forces have become trapped behind enemy lines. To reach safety, the units must cross the map and break through the defender’s forces, and then escape from those forces to the safety of their own lines. Attacking units may intentionally exit the map only at their Home Edge; a unit exiting from any other edge has retreated. The winner of the primary objective is determined via a modified combat score calculation. This scenario does not use the Forced Withdrawal rule.

![Alt text](/uploads/bt_smap/bt_smap3.PNG)

For Breakthrough, the attacker then chooses one of the narrow edges of the map as the place from which his forces will enter. The attacker’s Home Edge is the one opposite the entry edge. After the Attacker selects the entry Edge, then the defender will set up their force in any hex on the opposite half of the map. After the defender has deployed, the attacker enters the map through the standard TW/BMM rules. The attacker’s objective is to exit his forces off of his Home Map Edge.

The attacker must cross the map, and escape via their Home Edge. The Breakthrough Phase ends when all the defending units have been destroyed or retreated off the map, or when all attacking units have retreated, been destroyed, been crippled, or exited via their Home Edge. This scenario does not use the Forced Withdrawal rule, however, any units with crippling damage are counted as destroyed for the purpose of determining the winner of the primary objectives.

The winner of the primary objectives is the player with the higher number of victory points demonstrated below.

Breakthrough Victory Points (Attacker)
- 2x (Defender BV Killed) + Attacker BV Escaped - Attacker BV Lost.

Breakthrough Victory Points (Defender)
- 2x (Attacker BV Killed) - (Attacker BV Escaped + Defender BV Lost)

Note: Victory Points in this scenario are different from the Combat Score.


#### **#4) Map Control**
In this scenario, opposing forces battle to seize and control points on a vital piece of territory for as long as they possibly can. Both sides must vie for, and secure uncontested access to. This timed event can represent an effort to hold a strategic resource long enough to call for reinforcements, or secure a landing zone until a rescue DropShip arrives. To represent this a marker must be placed in a hex at the center of the map. This marker represents the key position that both sides are seeking to control. An additional control marker is placed in the center of each mapsheets (for a total of three). These markers represent the deployment zone and the area each side needs to defend. Players will deploy their force between the marker and their home edge in standard initiative order. All markers start off neutral and must be flipped to player control to score Victory Points.

![Alt text](/uploads/bt_smap/bt_smap4.PNG)

In order to capture and control the markers, a unit must be in contact (on or adjacent to the hex; pilot/crew conscious, and unit not imobile) with the objective marker, for an entire turn, with no hostile units also coming into similar contact that turn. While “holding” the objective in this fashion, the unit may make weapon and physical attacks as desired, but it cannot move out of contact with the objective marker. Once a marker is controlled it will generate Victory Points for the controlling side until it's contested by an opposing unit coming into contact, which will flip the marker back to neutral. If a hostile unit comes into contact with the objective marker, the position is considered contested, and will remain so until only units from one side are holding it for an entire turn, to flip it to a player's side again.

The primary objective is awarded to the force that holds the objective markers for the longest amount of time, with an extra bonus to whichever force controls the objective by the end of the final turn. To measure this, at the end of every turn in which a marker has been flipped, a player receives 1 Victory Points per controlled marker. In addition, whichever force holds the objective at the end of the scenario’s final turn will receive 2 Victory Points. This scenario ends when all markers have been flipped to a single side. or after a predefined time limit of 7 turns.


#### **#5) Recon Raid**
In a Reconnaissance Raid scenario, an attacking force must search a designated series of target caches for hidden resources, personnel, or other vital strategic assets—while trying to avoid getting shot to pieces by the defenders in the area.

![Alt text](/uploads/bt_smap/bt_smap5.PNG)

The Reconnaissance Raid scenario features a number of markers that will serve as the objectives of this event. Starting with the defender, the attacker and defender will alternate placing 10 objective markers on the defender's half of the map. All markers must be arranged on the defender's half of the map, and at least 3 full hexes to the edge of the map. All markers must be separated by at least 3 hexes. If available, buildings can be substituted for markers by agreement of both players..

The Attackers may place their units within their standard deployment zone. The Defenders treat the opposing map edge to the Attackers as their home edge for withdrawal purposes. Each Defendering unit must be deployed at least 6x hexes apart. Defenders may be deployed in their standard deployment zone (3x Hex in from their home Edge) or on or adjacent to any objective marker. Units will be deployed in the standard initiative order.

**Mission: Scanning Rule:** To successfully scan an objective, a unit must either end its Movement Phase on or adjacent to the hex with the target marker. Scans must be declared, and performed as that unit's primary attack during the first Combat Phase. Only one target can be scanned per turn. If a unit is equipped with a Probe, that unit can scan targets within the probes range bands. Scanning, or by coming within range of any active probes it carries and making a successful scanning “attack” against the marker (use the standard weapon attack rules for this scanning “attack”, including modifiers for short range, attacker’s movement, and intervening terrain, but ignore the markers immobile target modifier). All other weapons attacks while scanning (either adjacent or via probe) will be made to a secondary target with a +1 to hit modifier. A hostile ECM is capable of blocking the active probe but cannot block on or adjacent scans. Enemy units on or adjacent to the hex with a target marker will cause the scanning attempt to automatically fail. Scanning will also fail if the scanning unit is destroyed or the pilot becomes unconscious before the end of the combat phase.

Scanned markers count at one victory point, for each marker scanned the attacking player will roll a 1D6. On a 6 the attacker receives 2 points. A hostile ECM is capable of blocking the active probe but cannot block on or adjacent scans. The Attacker wins the primary objectives at the end of the turn, after successfully scanning targets, earning 5 points, and withdrawing with at least one unit, while the Defender wins if it can prevent this.


#### **#6) Extraction Raid**
An Extraction Raid scenario, has the attacking player attempts to extract a target, such as a secret weapon, an important diplomat or a computer memory core, from behind the defender’s lines. The target is considered to be at the level indicated on the hex.

![Alt text](/uploads/bt_smap/bt_smap6.PNG)

After the players select their home map edges, the attacker secretly chooses a target hex for the extraction. The target hex must be within four hex rows of the defender’s home edge and cannot be within four hexes of any other map edge. The attacker then writes down (or photographs and annotates) the target hex’s number and map sheet name.

The attacking player can reveal the target hex to the defender during any End Phase, but must reveal the target hex if an attacking unit ends the turn in the target hex. Any attacking unit (except VTOLs or WiGEs) can pick up the extraction target by occupying the target hex during an End Phase. Pickup cannot be made after a jump or a sprint. Once picked up, any jumping or sprinting will cause the package to be dropped in the current hex. In addition, a unit that retrieves the target can pass it to any friendly unit in the same hex or an adjacent hex during any End Phase. If a unit carrying the extraction target is destroyed or crippled, place a marker in the hex previously occupied by the unit. Any unit in play can retrieve the target by occupying the target hex during any End Phase. Hand actuators are not required to pick up the extraction target.

If the attacker can move a unit carrying the extraction target off his home map edge, they win the primary objective of the scenario at the end of the turn. Otherwise, the defender wins.


#### **#7) Objective Raid**
The Objective Raid scenario has the attacker attempting to destroy critical infrastructure or supply depots and then successfully withdraw. 

![Alt text](/uploads/bt_smap/bt_smap7.PNG)

For initial setup, the defender proposes 2 map configurations, the attacker selects one, the defender picks their home Edge with the attacker deploying on the other. The Defender places two target objective markers, between 4 and 10 hexes of their home Edge. Each marker represents a Level 1 structure with CF55 (55 HPs). The target can be destroyed by weapons, physicals, or being demolished if a heavy or assault mech or tracked vehicle enters the objective hex. Units capable of demolishing the objectives are considered to have entered the hex at ground level and will not fall as a result of the collapse. The objectives should be considered well camouflaged from above, and receive an additional +8 to hit modifier from Indirect Fire attacks, and units using VTOL or WIGE movement. Objectives cannot be damaged by BSP. This scenario follows standard deployment, with the exception that the defending player can deploy within 10 hexes of their home Edge. 

To complete the primary objective, the attacker must destroy both objectives and withdraw at least one Mech or Vehicle unit off of their home Edge. The Defender wins if they can destroy or place all of the attackers mechs and vehicles into forced withdrawal.


#### **#8) Control Raid**
In a Control Raid scenario, both forces must scan a designated series of target data caches for vital strategic information. Unfortunately there is only limited backhaul bandwidth, slowing down the process. The game ends during the end phase of the turn when all markers have been successfully scanned or at time.

![Alt text](/uploads/bt_smap/bt_smap8.PNG)

Players will place 11 markers representing targets on the map. The Defender will start by placing a 1x target marker within 2 hexes of the center of the map. Next, starting with the attacker, each player will then alternate place 5 additional markers each on their opponents side of the map:
- Rear Left & Right: Within 4x Hexes of Home Edge & 15 Hexes of the side.
- Left, Right: 4+ Hexes from Home Edge, & within 10 hexes of their side.
- Center Middle: 4+ Hexes from home Edge & more than 10 hexes from the sides.

All markers must be placed 3 full hexes to the edge of the map. All markers must be separated by at least 4 hexes from another marker. If available, level 2 buildings can be substituted for markers by agreement of both players. Units are then deployed per standard initiative order.

**Scanning:** To successfully scan an objective, a unit must either end its Movement Phase on or adjacent to the hex with the target marker. Scans must be declared, and performed as that unit's primary attack during the first Combat Phase. Only one target can be scanned per turn per unit. If a unit is equipped with a Probe, that unit can scan targets within the probes range bands. Scanning, or by coming within range of any active probes it carries and making a successful scanning “attack” against the marker (use the standard weapon attack rules for this scanning “attack”, including modifiers for short range, attacker’s movement, and intervening terrain, but ignore the markers immobile target modifier). All other weapons attacks while scanning (either adjacent or via probe) will be made to a secondary target with a +1 to hit modifier. A hostile ECM is capable of blocking the active probe but cannot block on or adjacent scans. Enemy units on or adjacent to the hex with a target marker will cause the scanning attempt to automatically fail. Scanning will also fail if the scanning unit is destroyed or the pilot becomes unconscious before the end of the combat phase.

Only two targets can be scanned by a player each turn. Each target can only be scanned once. For each marker successfully scanned, the player is awarded one Victory Point (VP). The winner of the primary objective is the player with the highest number of victory points during the end phase on the turn when the final marker is scanned, Or the highest number of victory points, on the turn when a force was defeated via unit destruction, getting placed into forced withdrawal, or if the game ends due to time.


#### **#9) Road Block**
Roadblock is a convoy destroy mission. The attacking force must destroy a majority of the supply convoy and escape.

![Alt text](/uploads/bt_smap/bt_smap9.PNG)

For this scenario, the defender chooses the: map, and their home edge, giving the attacker the opposite Edge. Players' home edges should be on the short sides of the map. When selecting the map, the defender should make sure they are not at a disadvantage when it comes to the scenario objectives. 

This scenario follows standard deployment, except the attacker can deploy within 6 hexes of their home edge, and the defending player can deploy within 10 hexes of their home edge. 3 Convoy vehicles (CVs) will enter the map from the defender's left side, between 4 and 10 hexes from the defender's home edge, and move two additional hexes. The 3 CVs will enter one per turn starting on turn 2. CVs must enter from a hex more than 2 hexes away from the previous CV's deployment hex.

CVs are represented by standard markers. They move before the standard movement phase. They are able to move up to three hexes per turn, ignoring facing changes, level changes, and underlying terrain. When crossing water hexes, they move on the surface of the water, regardless of depth. CVs have a TMM of +1 regardless of the number of hexes moved and receive all other defensive mods as per normal. CVs are wheeled vehicles from stacking and LOS purposes, but have no facing. CVs may only change one level per hex moved.

Each CV has 20 hit points. If an attack hits, do not roll location, just deal the damage directly. Once a CV takes 20 or more damage, it is destroyed. A CV cannot be damaged by BSP or take falling damage. 

To win the primary objective, the attacker must destroy at least two Convoy Vehicles and then withdraw at least one Mech or Vehicle unit, not in forced withdrawal, off of their home Edge. The defender wins once two CVs exit via the right side of the map or the entire attacking force is eliminated or placed into forced withdrawal.


#### **#10) Domination**
Domination is a King of the Kill scenario, where the players are fighting for control over a single critical zone of control.

![Alt text](/uploads/bt_smap/bt_smap10.PNG)

For a reference, place a marker in the center of the map. The domination circle will be centered on the marker, with a diameter of 7x hexes, or a circle of radius three. Both sides use standard deployment.

Victory points are scored by having the Heaviest Mech or non-VTOL Vehicle uncontested inside of the circle after the heat phase. The circle counts as contested; if there is a tie for heaviest unit or if your opponent has three or more contesting units (not a three unit lead) in the circle. Scoring or contesting units must not be in any of the following conditions: In Forced Withdrawal, Prone, immobile, have walking/crushing movement of 0, unconscious, or stunned. Infantry, Battle Armor, and VTOLs can contest the circle but cannot score victory points.

The first player to reach 4VP wins the primary objective.

#### **#11) Point Control**
In this scenario, opposing forces battle to seize and control points on a vital piece of territory for as long as they possibly can. This timed event can represent an effort to hold a strategic resource long enough to call for reinforcements, or secure a landing zone until a rescue DropShip arrives. To represent this a marker must be placed in a hex at the center of the map. This marker represents the key position that both sides are seeking to control. An additional control marker is placed in the center of each mapsheets (for a total of three). These markers represent the buffer around the central zone that each side needs to defend. All markers start off neutral and must be flipped to player control to score Victory Points.

![Alt text](/uploads/bt_smap/bt_smap11.PNG)

In order to capture and control the markers, a unit must be in contact (on or adjacent to the hex; pilot/crew conscious, and unit not imobile) with the objective marker, for an entire turn, with no hostile units also coming into similar contact that turn. While “holding” the objective in this fashion, the unit may make weapon and physical attacks as desired, but it cannot move out of contact with the objective marker. Once a marker is controlled it will generate Victory Points for the controlling side until it's contested by an opposing unit coming into contact, which will flip the marker back to neutral. If a hostile unit comes into contact with the objective marker, the position is considered contested, and will remain so until only units from one side are holding it for an entire turn, to flip it to a player's side again.

The primary objective is awarded to the force that holds the objective markers for the longest amount of time, with an extra bonus to whichever force controls the objective by the end of the final turn. To measure this, at the end of every turn in which a marker has been flipped, a player receives 1 Victory Points per controlled marker. In addition, whichever force holds the objective at the end of the scenario’s final turn will receive 2 Victory Points. This scenario ends when all markers have been flipped to a single side. or after a predefined time limit of 7 turns.


### --- **Secondary Objectives** ---
These are secondary objectives, to be rolled in addition to the primary scenario. 
These objectives factor into who wins the overall scenario and how the scenario win is calculated.

1. #### **Capture**
Cripple any enemy unit, but placing it into forced withdrawal (Crippling damage), and end the scenario with one of your units within two hexes (AS: 4”) of the crippled unit. Destroyed units cannot be captured. 

2. #### **Scouting**
During the Heat phase, have at least one unit simultaneously within three hexes of both the non-home Edge inside your opponents deployment zones. To complete this objective, the scouting units must be on the winning side or at least one scouting unit must withdraw via its home Edge.

3. #### **Clear the Air**
Destroy, or place into forced withdrawal, all opposing units with ECM, Tag, or C3 Equipment (AS: {To-Do: Note the AS Abilities}. If no unit meets this requirement, then the highest BV unit fielded will be substituted or, if playing an assassination objective, to destroy the highest BV non-commander unit.

4. #### **One Hand Tied**
Have a single unit that does not fire their weapons or perform physical attacks for the entire game. This unit must survive until the firing phase of the final turn of the game. This unit may still achieve non-combat objectives. This objective is not achieved if the controlling player concedes the scenario.

5. #### **Anti-Missile**
Destroy or cripple (forced withdrawal requirements) two units equipped with LRMs, eLRMs, MML, Thunderbolt, ATM or any weapons using LRM Ammo, or LRM-Like systems. If there are more than two units that meet these requirements, the two highest BV/units that meet the requirements must be selected. If not enough units to meet the requirement, then the two highest non-commander BV units fielded will be substituted.

6. #### **Wet-Work**
Destroy the Commanders Unit. Reminder: Crippled Units count as destroyed at the end of the scenario if not fully withdrawn via the players home Edge. If there is no designated Commander at the start of the match, the target is the highest BV unit. If playing an assassination objective, the secondary objective is to destroy the high BV non-commander unit.

7. #### **New Guy Syndrome**
Destroy or cripple (forced withdrawal requirements) the unit on the opposing side with the worst (or numerically highest) average skills. If more than one unit is tied for the lowest, then the non-Commander unit with the deployed value (base unit + skills) closest to 2500bv will be substituted. If still tied, destroying or crippling any unit that meets the requirement fulfills the objective. 

8. #### **Suppressing Fire**
Destroy or cripple (forced withdrawal requirements), two units with weapons capable of delivering 10pts of damage (ASL 2pt of Long Damage or more) to a target more than 15 hexes away. If there are more than two units that meet these requirements, the two highest BV units that meet the requirements must be selected. If not enough units meet the requirement, then the highest BV units fielded will be substituted.

9. #### **Size-Up**
Scan 3x non-destroyed units from the opposing side. Scanned units can be destroyed in later phases without penalty. See scanning rules in the Rules Appendix.

10. #### **Limit Mobility**
Destroy or cripple (forced withdrawal requirements) the two fastest units (by maximum ground movement speed) in the opposing force. VTOLs and other units without ground movement are not possible targets.

11. #### **Demonstrate Dominance**
Successfully DFA an enemy unit. To complete this objective, the DFA'ed unit must be crippled or destroyed before a primary objective and the DFAing unit must be on the winning side, or successfully exit the map via their home edge. A unit that exits this way does not count as destroyed for scoring purposes. The DFA'ed unit doesn't need to be destroyed or crippled by the DFA.

12. #### **Push them Around**
Successfully charge an enemy unit. To complete this objective, the charged unit must be crippled or destroyed before a primary objective is achieved, and the charging unit must be on the winning side, or successfully exit the map via their home edge. A unit that exits this way does not count as destroyed for scoring purposes. The charged unit doesn't need to be destroyed or crippled by the charge.
